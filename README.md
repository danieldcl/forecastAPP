XGBoost: accurate, moderate to long.\n
DecisionTree: moderate.\n
RandomForest: 10 trees, slow, requires RAM.\n
LinearRegression: fast, best for linear data.\n
1: select dependent attribute and independent attributes.\n
2: pick a predicting model and specify the number of predictions.\n
3: run prediction and see the results \n
