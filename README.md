Overview of the application:

	Our program works best for numerical data analysis.
	Each predicting model works differently.
	XGBoost: accurate, moderate to long.
	DecisionTree: moderate.
	RandomForest: 10 trees, slow, requires RAM.
	LinearRegression: fast, best for linear data.

	1: select dependent attribute and independent attributes.
	2: pick a predicting model and specify the number of predictions.
	3: run prediction and see the results.
